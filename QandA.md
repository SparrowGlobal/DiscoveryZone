If these art pieces are presented somewhere online, just as simple picture files, not as NFT’s, do they loose their value as possible future NTF’s ?

For example, an art piece is presented on a website as a simple GIF.

Later the artist mints it as an NFT and puts it up for sale on a market website.

Will this piece attract considerably lower offers as on NFT, because it was previously displayed as just a GIF ?

I don't think it impacts the market value much if at all.  I say this for two reasons: 1) no one can 'own' that GIF or JPEG on a website in the same way that someone can provably own a token.  You may 'own' it from a copyright perspective, but that is very different from owning the token associated with the piece which means that anyone can point to that token and see exactly who the owner is. Secondly, 2) the market value of artwork NFTs is influenced far more by reputation of the artist than necessarily by the particular work in question.  So, although a fresh new piece never seen before could command a higher value by a well known artist than a piece that is an previous work of theirs, The demand for the artist is the more significant factor, I think, in the artworks market price. Most artists will have to have built up their reputation off of the blockchain and that will mean having works viewable (and not tokenized) elsewhere.  It is therefore normal, and expected, that an artist will have a pre-existing body of work that isn't tokenized. I also think that most collectors will probably not be familar with an artists previous works, necessarily, so they may not even be aware if it has been published before.  And even if they were, it wouldn't matter veyr much, as they cannot purchase the other version as it is simply on a website with no token attached.

It seems like if one does not have a SR, KO or MS account the best thing is to post on Cent or Opensea to present their work.

Also as you mentioned, they might already have a portfolio somewhere.

But what if they don’t have a portfolio directly related to the type of art present on these sites, but have a skillset to make this type of art.

To make this more clear, currently these NFT sites are limited to image files only.

What if someone comes from a video / photography background, and can make art under the form of jpegs or GIF’s, what would be the best way to showcase those ?

Are there any other options besides Cent and Opensea ?


There is Creary & that is a good way to present a portfolio of work.  But no, what gets posted there aren't NFTs as Creary is bulit on its own blockchain, not Ethereum.  NFTs are ERC721 tokens, the standard defined on Ethereum.  I would say try Mintbase - as anyone can create their own contract there, you don't have to apply and be whitelisted like SR, KO, etc. - but their file limit size is relatively small, so that would probably not be the best for video based work, converted to GIFs, your file sizes would likely be too large, even still images, like high quality photographs, can be too large.  Another option is Rarible.  I've not created anything there yet, but I am planning to so that I can write the next part of the KYT series from direct experience.  That platform might be a good option for you, and I believe they may also support video, if not right now, relatively soon.

Probably the best strategy, if you're not on one of the permissioned "by-application-only" platforms where collectors will see your work normally in any case, is to create your tokens on one of the others (Mintbase, Rarible, OpenSea) and then post about them on Cent.  That will get them some visibility from collectors.  Most collectors are also on Twitter, so that is useful too.  Then, depending on how much 'marketing' you want to do, there are various Discord servers, Telegram channels and other places where work can be made visible, but all of those are likely lower returns than Cent & Twitter.

One of the really great things about cryptoart (in my view) is that artists are always pushing boundaries and exploring new things, so the wider the variety of 'art' that can be incorporated into this ecosystem the better in my view!  You may find that for right now you may need do GIFs or JPEGs, but platforms are well aware of requirements to expland the formats they support, video should be next.  There are plenty of voices asking for the ability to integrate sound with images, so video is the next logical step.

How do you decide how you price your pieces and is the pricing different depending on the site ?

Also how do you decide if you price a piece or just leave it open to bids without a visible price ?

What is an edition ? A series of pieces that have a common theme ?

Pricing is always very subjective!  And it's the most frequently asked question by artists. I was thinking about having a whole week's worth of discussions around the topic when I start the next phase of Crypto Art School which will be focused on mentored modules.  The general rule of thumb is scarcity commands a higher price.  So, an edition (as it is on Known Origin, is one artwork with a limited number of tokens - equivalent to a limited edition print in physical art) would normally be priced less per token than a one-of-one piece. Some of the platforms force you to set a price (KO does) so there is no option to just leave it open to bids.  For me, as I am not always checking to see if bids have come in, and there are days when I'm not at my computer much, I like to set prices so that no one is waiting for me to respond to a bid.  That's just doing to depend on how you operate best, I think.  Collectors don't like to leave their ETH tied up in bids for very long, it seems.  As for differences across sites, personally, I think it makes more sense to be consistent (obviously, with the one-of-one v edition differences being taken into account) and not have things vary too much across sites, unless the works are significantly different, take differing amounts of time, or have a different target audience.  So, for example, I will try to do some editions (with correspondingly lower price) so that more people can afford to collect my work.  I'm not worried about exclusivity, I'd like to have as many people as possible collecting my work (while still honouring the time and effort that goes into it).

If a piece is up, can the artist alter the price / take it down (if it has not sold of course), or it's set in stone ?

On most platforms you can change the price (SR, KO, etc.)  Currently if you create your own contract on Mintbase, you can't change the price after it is set. But that's one of the next controls they're going to add. As I've never tokenized on Makersplace or BlockchainArtExchange, I'm not sure about changing prices there.  I believe on OpenSea it allows you to reduce the price, but not to increase it... so something to keep in mind if you sell things through there.

I saw it’s pretty similar to Opensea, I noticed a user can post to either “Rarible” or “make a collection”.

I saw the collection was extra in fees, but even just posting to “Rarible” made my own page/marketplace, do you know what a collection is ? Several pieces under a common theme / title that automatically gets stamped on them or something else ?

On Rarible, you can either use their contract (and mint things as their tokens, like you do on SuperRare and KnownOrigin, etc.) or you can create your own contract with your own tokens (like on Mintbase) - I believe that's the difference between "Rarible" and "make a collection" in their terms.  Making a collection is creating your own contract (which yes, costs more in fees on Ethereum).  So any tokens that you created on one collection would all have the same token name, and on places like OpenSea (and EtherScan) you'd see the total number of those tokens.  So it can be a good way of creating a set that is the equivalent of limited edition items (and having that be verifiable by the blockchain records themselves).  That all gets rather fuzzy when you mix ing Known Origin 'Editions' which are difficult to work out (outside of the Known Origin site) how many there are in an 'edition'... I'm much more in favour of things being verifiable from just looking at the token. :)

There is also another section in the minting form where where you can enter “properties” and you must enter a “key” and a “value” do you have any idea what that is ?

Properties are any user defined value pairs you'd want your item to have.  (As the NFT spec wasn't really made for the art use case, it is like shoe-horning in things made for something else!  But for, say, the original NFT Crypto Kitties, they would have traits: rarity, colour, etc. etc. and these would all be speficied in value pair properties.

#7

Do properties like key and value have any use for art NFT’s or are pretty much useless ?

As for properties, I think they can be helpful.  Certainly OpenSea makes use of them, so if you are going to be selling things there, it makes sense to have a plan for properties.  Setting them is what generates the little boxes on an item's page on OpenSea...  So for example, I bought this yesterday: https://opensea.io/assets/0xfbeef911dc5821886e1dda71586d90ed28174b7d/139401 & you can see the 'Artist' 'Asset Type' and 'Scarcity' properties are set by KnownOrigin for their tokens.  All KODA tokens will have these.  They could be useful to artists.

I checked out Asyc Art and your piece on it, it’s really cool, how do the layers work, do you have to buy a piece for them to work ?

Async Art is really very cool indeed, and we've only begun to scratch the surface in demonstrating what might be possible...  The sign up for new artists will likely be up fairly soon - maybe next week?  But I expect it will be a little while, weeks or more, probably before they're ready to onboard new artists.  They've got a lot of web front end / user interface work to do.  What we did for the launch was pretty manual and bespoke just to get it out there.  That won't scale well, and isn't completely self-service as it will need to be when opening it up to new artists.  Thanks for the kind words about my piece!  It is definitely challenging work!  I mostly do still images, and with this not only did I have to think about moving pieces, but independently moving pieces, over time, in various ways and combinations. It's a lot to get your head around!!

The layers are each their own token.  The owner of the token for the individual layer has attributes (defined by the artist) for what parameters can be changed for that layer (scale, position, rotation, alternate images, opacity... basic things currently).  The token owner can update any or all of the attributes for their layer, which send a transaction to the smart contract for async art with an update() call.  They also developed a rendering engine that listens for the updated() event & when it gets one, it re-renders the master image (also a token) with the new parameters for that layer.  All really cool ideas!  And opens up so many interesting things for artists to do!  Some of which was hinted at in the presentation... but the update() could literally be triggered by all sorts of things, not just the token owner manually submitting a transaction.  That's just the first thing that was implemented.

What is the difference between platform tokens and artist tokens, aren't they all ERC721 and sellable by ETH ?

Yes, they are!

#10

What are the benefits of making your own token ?

The 'platform tokens' are the ones where the platform owns the smart contract, so the tokens are SUPR or KODA for SuperRare and KnownOrigin, for example).  An artist's own token will be from a contract that the artist owns (like creating a contract on Mintbase, or that 'collection' as they termed it - and yes, having different names for things is confusing!!).  The benefits of creating your own contract and making your own tokens is that a) it's permissionless - you don't have to apply and be accepted to a platform to do it; b) you are in control of what tokens get minted, so your work can be presented more cohesively (rather than just showing up in an activity stream of all other artists minting tokens on a platform); and c) if the platform that owns the contract goes away, you could potentially lose the ability to do some things with the tokens (this happened with Editional, who shut down, and their tokens were temporatily suspended/"blacklisted" on OpenSea prior to that, for example).

#11

How can you present your work more cohesively if you make your own token, like on your own website ?

Mintbase has a guide to adding thing to your own website... I believe it will even allow them to be bought without leaving your website.  Let me find the link to the instructions....

Here's the Mintbase guide for embedding your NFTs on your own site: https://docs.mintbase.io/getting-started/minter-ui/embedding-nfts

The limitations of NFT's as of now is image file and 5 MB size limit, right, but really, isn't it just the 5 MB size ?

In an artist can deliver a piece of music up to 5MB or a video file up to 5MB, it should work with the blockchain correct ?

There probably would be a bit of tweaking to be done for the website, because there would be the need for an audio or video player in the page that displays the artwork, but it should work...

Not all platforms have added support for video content.  I believe that as much as file size, it is also dependent on file format.  (So for example, a lot of people have been asking for webp but not all platforms support that either....
